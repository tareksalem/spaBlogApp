The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).",

        body: `Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.`,

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.`,

"What language (programming) should I learn for this year?"
This question is very often asked. But the problem with her is that it's like someone asking what car he should buy. The answer depends on several factors. Do you want to buy a new car or a used one? Which form do you prefer? What kind of engine do you expect?
It's also the same scenario with web development.

Do you want to work individually or for a company? How far are you willing to invest to learn? Do you have enough time to learn? What are your current capabilities when it comes to development? Why do you want to learn to program?

To begin
Note that this list is a simplified and appropriate list for 2018, thus not including all programming languages on the market. We will do our best to answer as honestly as possible the question asked previously. Obviously, it is not so easy to measure the popularity of a programming language.

After researching and analyzing popular designs like PYPL, TIOBE, Trendy Skills, Google Trends, and especially after speaking with experts, we can say that the trend for 2018 is:
Ø JavaScript
Ø Java
Ø Python
Ø TypeScript
Ø PHP
Ø C#

If you want to become a front-end developer
(HTML & CSS are not 'programming languages', but I put them on the list to help beginners.



HTML
html
HTML is the plan, the 'shell' of a website.
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and is dynamic, meaning you can create beautiful websites with fewer codes and do more things. It's a good language to learn for the next 3 years. Read what Steve Jobs said about HTML5 here. https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/28/now-that-youtube-has-jumped-to-html5-heres-what-steve-jobs-sai/







CSS
css
CSS gives a style to websites. You can find the things you can do with CSS by clicking here http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/.
CSS3 is the latest version of CSS and it is also dynamic. HTML5 and CSS3 work perfectly together.

Learn CSS here https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp.








Javascript
javascript11
JavaScript is the most used programming language in the world. JavaScript can be illustrated with 'if this, so this'. The latest version of JavaScript (ES2017) was released this year and developers are already excited to try it. Once you understand how JavaScript works, you should learn jQuery https://jquery.com/ . The latter is a library of different 'plugins' to add to your code. These plugins will save you time and make it easier for you to add functionality.
Note: JavaScript can also be a back-end language, but to put it simply, I put it in the front-end language section.
Learn JavaScript here https://www.javascript.com/resources








TypeScript
typescript
TypeScript is a static language that compiles with JavaScript and is growing rapidly! The new version 2.1 includes all new features with static type options. One of its advantages is also better bug control in your code or against any typos, async / await and more https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/12/07/announcing-typescript-2-1/ It is also the preferred language for writing Angular 2 applications.
Learn TypeScript here https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html
 and here https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-typescript-microsoft-dev201x-1







If you want to become a back-end developer




PHP
php
PHP is the most popular server-side programming language in the world.
It is generally used as a basis for Content Management Systems (CMS) for WordPress and other websites such as Wikipedia and Facebook.
PHP 7.1 was released in December 2016.
Learn PHP here http://www.learn-php.org/



Django on Python
django-on-python
Python is an object-oriented language that is very similar to the English language. This makes it an excellent language to learn for beginners as well as for experienced professionals.
Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, NASA, for example, all use Python.
The Python 3.6 release came out in December 2016 with great features

Asp.net
asp.net
C # ('see-sharp') is a programming language widely used in the world. It is not just limited to the Microsoft's .NET platform.
It is also used for iOS and Android applications with Xamarin technology and Windows applications.
Version 7.0 was released in August 2016 with incredible features.
Learn C # here https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-from-scratch



Ruby on rails
ruby-on-rails
Rails is a framework built on Ruby programming language, it's released the first time in 2004, but it became very popular in latest years, ruby on rails now rivals other backend web technologies such as node.js, Django, PHP, you can learn it from its official website and documentation from this link: http://rubyonrails.org/.



Node.js
nodejs_logo
Node.js is a powerful environment to let javascript programming language works on the server side, it used in web programming and it has good and powerful benefits especially in chat programming because it works with the non-blocking concept and it builds amazing real-time apps.






In summary
If you want to become a full stack developer, we recommend you learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. And once you master these 'languages', learn TypeScript and two back-end languages of your choice.
It's NOT KNOW everything that counts, but what you are able to DO with the knowledge you have.
Remember that it's not because you master JavaScript, C #, Ruby, Go, and others as a leader that you will necessarily have a job. This is the biggest of the programming:

It's up to you. We showed you the best programming languages of 2018. Now it's up to you to choose the best for you!

7 tips to increase productivity
pic4


With these 7 tips, discover how you can increase your productivity day after day ... No, do not be afraid, it's not hard!

1 - To be ordered
According to Einstein, genius dominates chaos, but when you take a closer look, this statement is relative!

For a day's work, the order greatly facilitates productivity. A German study by the Fraunhofer Institute results, that employees spend 10% of their time looking for missing work material! Not to mention that this frantic search produces stress, you could also put this time to profit from something else ... It is, therefore, worthwhile to keep his office or his files (computer or other) tidy!

2 - Music to increase creativity            
A phrase that says a lot about the relationship between music and increased productivity. In December 2012, the Journal of Consumer Research published a study that found that productivity is higher with background noise than with silence, or with a lot of noise.

here are other studies that show the positive effect of music on productivity, provided that it does not disturb your colleagues (the tastes of each are different)
Therefore, it is strongly recommended to listen to his music with headphones to create a pleasant sound environment.
 The department stores often pass music adapted to their target audience.

3 - Put your mobile phone aside

A mobile phone is a useful tool that has also become a problematic invention. Calls, messages, and alerts threaten to distract you at any time!

Psychology professor Christian Ulmer estimates that we spend three hours a day on our cell phone. The work is interrupted during this short break, without it being so relaxing. By simply keeping an eye on his phone, the focus on the current project is permanently interrupted and the phone becomes a formidable enemy of productivity.

The solution is very simple: each phone has a plane mode, use it during your working hours!

4 - Internet, yes but not for personal use

What is good for the mobile phone in your workplace is also good for the internet. Professional communication depends on a lot of internets but it must be strictly separated from private use, otherwise, you are constantly distracted, as with a phone.

Surfing the net for personal reasons must remain an occupation for your free time, a moment of relaxation after work!

5 - Do not constantly consult your E-Mails
E-mails are a very practical invention, they can be sent quickly and without consuming paper. However, many people tend to read their messages immediately and thus interrupt ongoing tasks.

In such a case, email becomes an enemy of productivity with the consequences we know. Increase your productivity at work by setting filters in your inbox.

For important emails, set a specific folder in your email so you can read them immediately. Then consider all participants and potential items in these emails so they can be recognized by your email.

All other messages will be received in a different folder that you will only see at certain times (at the end of the day or during a break for example).

6 - Learn to prioritize your work

Operating systems have become multitasking and even smartphones manage to multitask.
Man, however, is a living being, and as such, is programmed to focus on one task at a time. It is therefore advisable to regularly take the time to structure your working days.
Sort your tasks in order of importance and get the most urgent tasks first. You will be able to postpone a minimum overnight and check the importance of remaining tasks and upcoming appointments.
Your next meeting, for example: is it really worth attending? Will topics of importance to you be covered? Maybe you can wait until this information is communicated in a collective E-Mail?
It is also helpful to sort your files efficiently, placing the most important one above and the least urgent at the bottom of the stack. This will allow you to focus visually on your priorities and work more effectively.

7 - Manage your time flexibility

A rigid workday structure, without flexibility, allows for little change and thus reduces productivity. The German research institute Fraunhofer has discovered that temporal flexibility results in more efficient work. It is, therefore, necessary to free oneself from the rigid constraints of time and replace them with clear objectives.

In the end…As we have just seen, it is quite easy to defeat the multiple enemies of productivity. For starters, a framed use of devices and electronic media is extremely useful. If in addition, your daily schedules remain flexible, and if you can listen to the music of your choice, in suitable conditions, then you have everything to gain.


These are some simple steps that can be put into practice quickly so you can work more efficiently`,
